# Example: `spectrepro-vt` Selection Gestures

This contains a simple example of how to use the `spectrepro-vt` selection
gesture API from C. It creates synthetic press, drag, release, and deep-press
events and formats the resulting selection snapshots.

This uses a `build.zig` and `Zig` to build the C program so that we
can reuse a lot of our build logic and depend directly on our source
tree, but SpectrePro emits a standard C library that can be used with any
C tooling.

## Usage

Run the program:

```shell-session
zig build run
```
