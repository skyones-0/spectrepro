/// An interface that handles the lifecycle of dynamically loaded types.

/// The GObject type system supports dynamic loading of types.

///
/// 1. The type is initially introduced (usually upon loading the module
///    the first time, or by your main application that knows what modules
///    introduces what types), like this:
///    ```c
///    new_type_id = g_type_register_dynamic (parent_type_id,
///                                           "TypeName",
///                                           new_type_plugin,
///                                           type_flags);
///    ```
///    where `new_type_plugin` is an implementation of the
///    `GTypePlugin` interface.
///
/// 2. The type's implementation is referenced, e.g. through
///    `gobject.TypeClass.ref` or through `gobject.typeCreateInstance`
///    (this is being called by `gobject.Object.new`) or through one of the above
///    done on a type derived from `new_type_id`.
///
/// 3. This causes the type system to load the type's implementation by calling
///    `gobject.TypePlugin.use` and `gobject.TypePlugin.completeTypeInfo`
///    on `new_type_plugin`.
///
/// 4. At some point the type's implementation isn't required anymore, e.g. after
///    `gobject.TypeClass.unref` or `gobject.typeFreeInstance`
///    (called when the reference count of an instance drops to zero).
///
/// 5. This causes the type system to throw away the information retrieved
///    from `gobject.TypePlugin.completeTypeInfo` and then it calls
///    `gobject.TypePlugin.unuse` on `new_type_plugin`.
///
/// 6. Things may repeat from the second step.
///
/// So basically, you need to implement a `GTypePlugin` type that
/// carries a use_count, once use_count goes from zero to one, you need
/// to load the implementation to successfully handle the upcoming
/// `gobject.TypePlugin.completeTypeInfo` call. Later, maybe after
/// succeeding use/unuse calls, once use_count drops to zero, you can
/// unload the implementation again. The type system makes sure to call
/// `gobject.TypePlugin.use` and `gobject.TypePlugin.completeTypeInfo`
/// again when the type is needed again.

/// In the case of C programs, a closure usually just holds a pointer

/// converts between `Value` and native C types. The GObject
/// library provides the `CClosure` type for this purpose. Bindings for
/// other languages need marshallers which convert between [GValues]`Value`
/// and suitable representations in the runtime of the language in
/// order to use functions written in that language as callbacks. Use
/// `Closure.setMarshal` to set the marshaller on such a custom
/// closure implementation.
///
/// Within GObject, closures play an important role in the
/// implementation of signals. When a signal is registered, the
/// `c_marshaller` argument to `signalNew` specifies the default C
/// marshaller for any closure which is connected to this
/// signal. GObject provides a number of C marshallers for this
/// purpose, see the `g_cclosure_marshal_*()` functions. Additional C
/// marshallers can be generated with the [glib-genmarshal][glib-genmarshal]
/// utility.  Closures can be explicitly connected to signals with
/// `signalConnectClosure`, but it usually more convenient to let
/// GObject create a closure automatically by using one of the
/// `g_signal_connect_*()` functions which take a callback function/user
/// data pair.
///
/// Using closures has a number of important advantages over a simple
/// callback function/data pointer combination:
///
/// - Closures allow the callee to get the types of the callback parameters,
///   which means that language bindings don't have to write individual glue
///   for each callback type.
///
/// - The reference counting of `Closure` makes it easy to handle reentrancy
///   right; if a callback is removed while it is being invoked, the closure
///   and its parameters won't be freed until the invocation finishes.
///
/// - `Closure.invalidate` and invalidation notifiers allow callbacks to be
///   automatically removed when the objects they point to go away.
