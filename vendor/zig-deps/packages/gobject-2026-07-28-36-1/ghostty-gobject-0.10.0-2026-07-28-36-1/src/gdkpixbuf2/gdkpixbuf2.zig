/// A pixel buffer.
///
/// `GdkPixbuf` contains information about an image's pixel data,
/// its color space, bits per sample, width and height, and the
/// rowstride (the number of bytes between the start of one row
/// and the start of the next).
///
/// ## Creating new `GdkPixbuf`
///
/// The most basic way to create a pixbuf is to wrap an existing pixel
/// buffer with a `gdkpixbuf.Pixbuf` instance. You can use the
/// `gdkpixbuf.Pixbuf.newFromData` function to do this.
///
/// Every time you create a new `GdkPixbuf` instance for some data, you
/// will need to specify the destroy notification function that will be
/// called when the data buffer needs to be freed; this will happen when
/// a `GdkPixbuf` is finalized by the reference counting functions. If
/// you have a chunk of static data compiled into your application, you
/// can pass in `NULL` as the destroy notification function so that the
/// data will not be freed.
///
/// The `gdkpixbuf.Pixbuf.new` constructor function can be used
/// as a convenience to create a pixbuf with an empty buffer; this is
/// equivalent to allocating a data buffer using ``malloc`` and then
/// wrapping it with ``gdkpixbuf.Pixbuf.newFromData``. The ``gdkpixbuf.Pixbuf.new``
/// function will compute an optimal rowstride so that rendering can be
/// performed with an efficient algorithm.
///
/// You can also copy an existing pixbuf with the `Pixbuf.copy`
/// function. This is not the same as just acquiring a reference to
/// the old pixbuf instance: the copy function will actually duplicate
/// the pixel data in memory and create a new `Pixbuf` instance
/// for it.
///
/// ## Reference counting
///
/// `GdkPixbuf` structures are reference counted. This means that an
/// application can share a single pixbuf among many parts of the
/// code. When a piece of the program needs to use a pixbuf, it should
/// acquire a reference to it by calling ``gobject.Object.ref``; when it no
/// longer needs the pixbuf, it should release the reference it acquired
/// by calling ``gobject.Object.unref``. The resources associated with a
/// `GdkPixbuf` will be freed when its reference count drops to zero.
/// Newly-created `GdkPixbuf` instances start with a reference count
/// of one.
///
/// ## Image Data
///
/// Image data in a pixbuf is stored in memory in an uncompressed,
/// packed format. Rows in the image are stored top to bottom, and
/// in each row pixels are stored from left to right.
///
/// There may be padding at the end of a row.
///
/// The "rowstride" value of a pixbuf, as returned by `gdkpixbuf.Pixbuf.getRowstride`,
/// indicates the number of bytes between rows.
///
/// **NOTE**: If you are copying raw pixbuf data with ``memcpy`` note that the
/// last row in the pixbuf may not be as wide as the full rowstride, but rather
/// just as wide as the pixel data needs to be; that is: it is unsafe to do
/// `memcpy (dest, pixels, rowstride * height)` to copy a whole pixbuf. Use
/// `gdkpixbuf.Pixbuf.copy` instead, or compute the width in bytes of the
/// last row as:
///
/// ```c
/// last_row = width * ((n_channels * bits_per_sample + 7) / 8);
/// ```
///
/// The same rule applies when iterating over each row of a `GdkPixbuf` pixels
/// array.
///
/// The following code illustrates a simple ``put_pixel``
/// function for RGB pixbufs with 8 bits per channel with an alpha
/// channel.
///
/// ```c
/// static void
/// put_pixel (GdkPixbuf *pixbuf,
///            int x,
///        int y,
///        guchar red,
///        guchar green,
///        guchar blue,
///        guchar alpha)
/// {
///   int n_channels = gdk_pixbuf_get_n_channels (pixbuf);
///
///   // Ensure that the pixbuf is valid
///   g_assert (gdk_pixbuf_get_colorspace (pixbuf) == GDK_COLORSPACE_RGB);
///   g_assert (gdk_pixbuf_get_bits_per_sample (pixbuf) == 8);
///   g_assert (gdk_pixbuf_get_has_alpha (pixbuf));
///   g_assert (n_channels == 4);
///
///   int width = gdk_pixbuf_get_width (pixbuf);
///   int height = gdk_pixbuf_get_height (pixbuf);
///
///   // Ensure that the coordinates are in a valid range
///   g_assert (x >= 0 && x < width);
///   g_assert (y >= 0 && y < height);
///
///   int rowstride = gdk_pixbuf_get_rowstride (pixbuf);
///
///   // The pixel buffer in the GdkPixbuf instance
///   guchar *pixels = gdk_pixbuf_get_pixels (pixbuf);
///
///   // The pixel we wish to modify
///   guchar *p = pixels + y * rowstride + x * n_channels;
///   p[0] = red;
///   p[1] = green;
///   p[2] = blue;
///   p[3] = alpha;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Loading images
///
/// The `GdkPixBuf` class provides a simple mechanism for loading
/// an image from a file in synchronous and asynchronous fashion.
///
/// For GUI applications, it is recommended to use the asynchronous
/// stream API to avoid blocking the control flow of the application.
///
/// Additionally, `GdkPixbuf` provides the `gdkpixbuf.@"PixbufLoader`"`
/// API for progressive image loading.
///
/// ## Saving images
///
/// The `GdkPixbuf` class provides methods for saving image data in
/// a number of file formats. The formatted data can be written to a
/// file or to a memory buffer. `GdkPixbuf` can also call a user-defined
/// callback on the data, which allows to e.g. write the image
/// to a socket or store it in a database.

/// Incremental image loader.
///
/// `GdkPixbufLoader` provides a way for applications to drive the
/// process of loading an image, by letting them send the image data
/// directly to the loader instead of having the loader read the data
/// from a file. Applications can use this functionality instead of
/// ``gdkpixbuf.Pixbuf.newFromFile`` or ``gdkpixbuf.PixbufAnimation.newFromFile``
/// when they need to parse image data in small chunks. For example,
/// it should be used when reading an image from a (potentially) slow
/// network connection, or when loading an extremely large file.
///
/// To use `GdkPixbufLoader` to load an image, create a new instance,
/// and call `gdkpixbuf.PixbufLoader.write` to send the data
/// to it. When done, `gdkpixbuf.PixbufLoader.close` should be
/// called to end the stream and finalize everything.
///
/// The loader will emit three important signals throughout the process:
///
///  - `gdkpixbuf.PixbufLoader.signals.size_prepared` will be emitted as
///    soon as the image has enough information to determine the size of
///    the image to be used. If you want to scale the image while loading
///    it, you can call `gdkpixbuf.PixbufLoader.setSize` in
///    response to this signal.
///  - `gdkpixbuf.PixbufLoader.signals.area_prepared` will be emitted as
///    soon as the pixbuf of the desired has been allocated. You can obtain
///    the `GdkPixbuf` instance by calling `gdkpixbuf.PixbufLoader.getPixbuf`.
///    If you want to use it, simply acquire a reference to it. You can
///    also call ``gdkpixbuf.PixbufLoader.getPixbuf`` later to get the same
///    pixbuf.
///  - `gdkpixbuf.PixbufLoader.signals.area_updated` will be emitted every
///    time a region is updated. This way you can update a partially
///    completed image. Note that you do not know anything about the
///    completeness of an image from the updated area. For example, in an
///    interlaced image you will need to make several passes before the
///    image is done loading.
///
/// ## Loading an animation
///
/// Loading an animation is almost as easy as loading an image. Once the
/// first `gdkpixbuf.PixbufLoader.signals.area_prepared` signal has been
/// emitted, you can call `gdkpixbuf.PixbufLoader.getAnimation` to
/// get the `gdkpixbuf.PixbufAnimation` instance, and then call
/// and `gdkpixbuf.PixbufAnimation.getIter` to get a
/// `gdkpixbuf.PixbufAnimationIter` to retrieve the pixbuf for the
/// desired time stamp.

/// If `GdkPixbuf` has been compiled with `GModule` support, it can be extended

/// formats.
///
/// ## Implementing modules
///
/// The `GdkPixbuf` interfaces needed for implementing modules are contained in
/// `gdk-pixbuf-io.h` (and `gdk-pixbuf-animation.h` if the module supports
/// animations). They are not covered by the same stability guarantees as the
/// regular GdkPixbuf API. To underline this fact, they are protected by the
/// `GDK_PIXBUF_ENABLE_BACKEND` pre-processor symbol.
///
/// Each loadable module must contain a `GdkPixbufModuleFillVtableFunc` function
/// named `fill_vtable`, which will get called when the module
/// is loaded and must set the function pointers of the `GdkPixbufModule`.
///
/// In order to make format-checking work before actually loading the modules
/// (which may require calling `dlopen` to load image libraries), modules export
/// their signatures (and other information) via the `fill_info` function. An
/// external utility, `gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders`, uses this to create a text
/// file containing a list of all available loaders and  their signatures.
/// This file is then read at runtime by `GdkPixbuf` to obtain the list of
/// available loaders and their signatures.
///
/// Modules may only implement a subset of the functionality available via
/// `GdkPixbufModule`. If a particular functionality is not implemented, the
/// `fill_vtable` function will simply not set the corresponding
/// function pointers of the `GdkPixbufModule` structure. If a module supports
/// incremental loading (i.e. provides `begin_load`, `stop_load` and
/// `load_increment`), it doesn't have to implement `load`, since `GdkPixbuf`
/// can supply a generic `load` implementation wrapping the incremental loading.
///
/// ## Installing modules
///
/// Installing a module is a two-step process:
///
///  - copy the module file(s) to the loader directory (normally
///    `$libdir/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/$version/loaders`, unless overridden by the
///    environment variable `GDK_PIXBUF_MODULEDIR`)
///  - call `gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders` to update the module file (normally
