/** @defgroup selection Selection
 *
 * A snapshot selection range defined by two grid references that identifies
 * a contiguous or rectangular region of terminal content.
 *
 * The start and end values are SpectreProGridRef values. They are therefore
 * untracked grid references and inherit the same lifetime rules: they are
 * only safe to use until the next mutating operation on the terminal that
 * produced them, including freeing the terminal. To keep a selection valid
 * across terminal mutations, callers must maintain tracked grid references
 * for the endpoints and reconstruct a SpectreProSelection from fresh snapshots
 * when needed.
 *
 * Selection gestures provide a reusable state machine for turning UI pointer
 * interactions into selection snapshots. A caller creates one
 * SpectreProSelectionGesture per active gesture stream, reuses typed
 * SpectreProSelectionGestureEvent objects for synthetic press, drag, release,
 * autoscroll tick, and deep-press events, and applies each event with
 * spectrepro_selection_gesture_event(). The returned SpectreProSelection is a
 * snapshot; the embedder decides whether to render it, format/copy it, or
 * install it as the terminal's active selection.
 *
