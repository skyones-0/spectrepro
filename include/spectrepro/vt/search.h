/** @defgroup search Search
 *
 * Search a terminal for a string, covering the active area and
 * scrollback of both the primary and alternate screens.
 *
 * A SpectreProSearch searches the terminal it was created with for a
 * needle set with SPECTREPRO_SEARCH_OPT_NEEDLE. It handles the hard
 * parts of terminal search internally: results stay in sync with the
 * live screens, survive primary/alternate screen switches (entering
 * and leaving a fullscreen app such as vim does not restart a
 * scrollback search), and recover from resize, reflow, resets, and
 * scrollback pruning.
 *
 * A search starts idle. Setting the needle starts the search,
 * changing it restarts the search from scratch, and clearing it
 * returns the search to idle. Matching is byte-exact except ASCII
 * letters, which compare case-insensitively.
 *
 * ## Driving a search
 *
 * Searching a large scrollback takes time, so the work is split into
 * small steps the caller drives so that the caller can control
 * performance more directly:
 *
 * - spectrepro_search_tick() makes a bounded amount of progress on data
 *   the search has already copied. It never touches the terminal, 
 *   meaning it can be safely called from a thread.
 * - spectrepro_search_feed() reads the terminal to copy in more data and
 *   pick up terminal changes. Feeding is the only way the search
 *   learns that the terminal changed, so keep feeding periodically
 *   while the search is in use. This requires exclusive terminal access.
 * - spectrepro_search_run() is a blocking convenience that feeds and
 *   ticks until the search is caught up.
 *
 * SPECTREPRO_SEARCH_STATUS_COMPLETE means the search is caught up with
 * the terminal as of the last feed. It never means finished forever,
 * since later terminal writes require another feed to be seen.
 *
 * ## Matches are selections
 *
 * Every match is returned as a SpectreProSelection snapshot with
 * rectangle set to false, so the existing selection APIs all work on
 * matches: spectrepro_terminal_selection_format_buf() to copy the
 * matched text, spectrepro_terminal_point_from_grid_ref() with
 * SPECTREPRO_POINT_TAG_VIEWPORT to position highlight rectangles,
 * spectrepro_terminal_selection_contains() for hit testing, and
 * spectrepro_terminal_set() with SPECTREPRO_TERMINAL_OPT_SELECTION to make
 * a match the terminal's selection.
 *
 * Returned matches follow the usual snapshot lifetime rules: they are
 * only valid until the next operation that modifies the terminal,
 * including spectrepro_terminal_vt_write(), resize, reset, and free.
 * Read matches after a feed, use them before the terminal changes
 * again, and re-read them rather than caching them. The selected
 * match is kept accurate internally across terminal changes, so the
 * safe way to follow a match is to re-read
 * SPECTREPRO_SEARCH_DATA_SELECTED_MATCH after each feed.
 *
 * ## Lifetime
 *
 * The search borrows the terminal it was created with and never frees
 * it. Any number of searches, alongside other terminal readers such
 * as formatters and render states, may share one terminal.
 *
 * The search and its terminal can be freed in either order. Freeing
 * the search first releases tracked state it holds within the
 * terminal. If the terminal is freed first, the search detects this:
 * calls that need the terminal return SPECTREPRO_INVALID_VALUE, reads
 * return whatever the search last saw, and spectrepro_search_free()
 * releases only search-owned memory. A search cannot be rebound, so
 * searching another terminal means creating a new search.
 *
 * ## Threading
 *
 * The library creates no threads. Calls on one SpectreProSearch are not
 * safe to make concurrently with each other, so the caller must
 * serialize them.
 *
 * Functions that touch the terminal (spectrepro_search_new(),
 * spectrepro_search_feed(), spectrepro_search_run(), spectrepro_search_set()
 * with the needle and select options, and spectrepro_search_free()) must
 * also be serialized with all other access to the same terminal.
 *
 * Everything else (spectrepro_search_tick(), spectrepro_search_get(), and
 * spectrepro_search_get_multi()) only touches memory owned by the search
 * and is safe to call while another thread modifies the terminal.
 * This split is how SpectrePro runs search on a background thread: tick
 * freely, and take the terminal lock only to feed. Reading returned
 * match values is always safe, but passing them to APIs that take the
 * terminal follows the terminal serialization rule above.
