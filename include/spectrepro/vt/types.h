/**
 * Enum int-sizing helpers.
 *
 * The Zig side backs all C enums with c_int, so the C declarations
 * must use int as their underlying type to maintain ABI compatibility.
 *
 * C++11 and C23 support explicit enum underlying types with
 * `enum : int { ... }`. Clang and GCC 13+ also support this syntax as
 * an extension in older C language modes, so use it when available.
 *
 * Other pre-C23 C compilers are free to choose any type that can
 * represent all values (C11 §6.7.2.2). For those compilers, we add an
 * INT_MAX sentinel as the last entry so the compatible type must be
 * able to represent INT_MAX. The exact compatible type and its
 * signedness remain implementation-defined in this fallback.
 *
 * INT_MAX is used rather than a fixed constant like 0xFFFFFFFF
 * because enum constants must have type int in pre-C23 C. Values above
 * INT_MAX are a constraint violation there; compilers that accept them
 * may interpret them as negative values via two's complement, which can
 * collide with legitimate negative enum values.
 *
 * Usage:
 * @code
 * typedef enum SPECTREPRO_ENUM_TYPED {
 *     FOO_A = 0,
 *     FOO_B = 1,
 *     FOO_MAX_VALUE = SPECTREPRO_ENUM_MAX_VALUE,
 * } Foo;
 * @endcode

/**
 * Return the versioned libspectrepro-vt C type manifest for the current target.
 *
 * The manifest defines all the public types available in the linked
 * build. The types contain their layouts, enum values, union fields, and more.
 *
 * Language bindings, such as WebAssembly hosts, should obtain offsets,
 * sizes, alignments, array shapes, enum constants, and tagged-union arms from
 * this manifest rather than hardcoding them. Consumers should reject unknown
 * schema versions and verify the descriptors they require at initialization.
 *
 * Packed type descriptors define fields using `lsb` and `width`. `lsb` is
 * relative to bit zero of the containing numerical value; for nested packed
 * layouts it is relative to the immediate containing field. Tagged packed
 * unions select an inline arm layout using the named tag field. These layouts
 * describe the current linked build and are not a cross-version stability
 * promise.
 *
 * The formal format is defined by the
 * <a href="types.schema.json">libspectrepro-vt ABI manifest JSON Schema</a>.
